## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Creating the github project board and issues for the first time. While this was a new experience, it is something I wll use in the future as it kept me organized and on task.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

As with all planning, it was challenging to transfer my basic ideas into words rather than just actions.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

There were a few tasks that were not completed. For the next sprint, I will focus on functionality before explicit design.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Current "at risk" features include additional features such as github integration/user authentication and user notifications. Currently, these are planned for the last sprint and are regarded as "by-chance" so if they are not completed, the project will still be functional.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I don't believe I currently need any additional support for this upcoming unit/sprint.
