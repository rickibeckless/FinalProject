## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

This was mostly the same as last unit and I was able to keep making steady progress.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I've allowed admin to create and send notifications to either specific users or all users. I've also added a feature to allow users to view notifications. Implementing the notification feature took a bit longer than I'd expected it to because I'd wanted there to be an icon on the users profile picture that showed the number of unread notifications. I had to figure out how to do this, in then end I learned about Websockets and used Socket.io to implement this feature.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Most of the tasks were completed. I again got caught up in styling rather than functionality. I would prioritize the remaining tasks by doing functionality and implementation first and then styling.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Somehow, I've already completed the "at risk" features. That wasn't planned, and I'm glad I got to include them, but now I've got to be quick with getting all of the required features done.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I don't think any additional support is currently needed.
