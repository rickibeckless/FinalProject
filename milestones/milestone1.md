## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Once a theme was decided on, ideas for what the application would feature came easier than expected. The guided planning was also a useful tactic as it discouraged "jumping in the deep-end" and instead demonstrated good planning practice.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The main hurdle was getting ideas for the project's theme and then settling on features that would and wouldn't be implemented.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Not much. Going forwards extreme focus will have to be placed on time management and setting realistic goals for wanted app features.
